```

## Installation and compilation

You need a C compiler and git.  With those, you can clone this project
and compile the code into the spip binary like this in your Unix terminal:

```sh
# first clone it from GitHub, and get a submodule for it
git clone https://github.com/eriqande/spip.git
cd spip
git submodule init
git submodule update


# then compile it using the provided shell script
./CompileSpip.sh 
```

There will be a couple of warnings when you compile, but nothing fatal.

## Quick documentation

After that, you can get the short help for spip by typing `./spip --help`.  It will
spit out a short listing of the options.
```{sh}
./spip --help
```

If you want more complete information about that, use
```sh
./spip --help-full
```

You may wish to put `spip` in your PATH.

## Tutorial files

Now, to learn how to use spip, you can use the tutorial.  Do like this first:
```{sh, eval=FALSE}
cp -r data/examples_for_dis ./
mv examples_for_dis examples
```
